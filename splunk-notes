Splunk 

Splunk 
- is an IT operations tool that consumes machine-data in real time.
- Operational Intelligence
- Data visualisation
- Alerting
- Reporting
- Investigation
- Can handle structured and unstructured data.

Indexer - categorizes and applies metadata to the data. Allow users to create dashboards, alerts, and reports based on the data.

Basic Components of Splunk
- Search head
    - Handles search requests and consolidating results back to the user
- Indexer
    - Takes raw data from forwarders, turns it into events, and places the results into an index, which is stored in a bucket.
- Forwarder
    - Forwards raw data to other parts of the deployment.
    - 2 kinds of forwarders:
        - Universal : minimal configuration required.
        - Heavy: fine tuned for the needs.

Splunk Deployment Models
- Variety of configurations
- Data pipeline has four components
    - Input
    - Parsing
    - Indexing
    - Searching

Kinds of Deployment Models
1. Departmental Deployment - A single search head/indexer.  Upto 10 forwarders. Appropriate for up to 10 users.
￼
2. Small Enterprise Deployment - A single search head. 2-3 indexers. 100 to 200 forwarders.
￼
3. Large Enterprise Deployment - Clustered Search Head. Lots of indexers. Thousands of forwarders. A deployer.

Splunk Apps
- Apps extend Splunk’s functionality
- Apps can be created  by third parties, individuals, or Splunk
- Apps that are built by Splunk carry the “Splunk build” logo
- Apps that re certified by Splunk carry the “Splunk certified” logo
- Other apps may not have passed the Splunk certification, but that doesn’t mean they aren’t useful.
- An app is a collection of Splunk configuration files.
- Add-ons specify data collection, but do not have GUIs because the are part of the larger app
- Downloaded from splunkbase.com
- Most apps are free, however there are a few premiums apps for which you’ll need a license. These includes:
    - Splunk app for enterprise security
    - Splunk app for PCI compliance
    - Splunk app for VMware
    - Splunk app for Microsoft Exchange


Dealing with Time

￼
￼

Search Modes
1. Fast - no field discovery, except the metadata fields. Use if you know exactly what fields you need and can specify them in the search string.
2. Smart - returns the best results for whatever search you are running
3. Verbose - discover all fields it can. Use if you are not sure what fields you will want to report on.

Intermediate Searching

TOP
- Top <field>
- Returns the most common values of a given field.
- Defaults to 10 fields
- Can be combined with a limit=number
- Automatically builds a table with count and percent columns
- Can be used with multiple fields.
    - Return the top value for a field organised by another field

RARE
- Rare <field>
- Opposite of top
- Returns the least common values of field
- Options are identical to top

STATS
- Stats <function(field)> BY <field(s)>
- Some common functions (count, avg, max, min, sum, values, list, etc.)


Data Models
- Make machine data easier to use
- Simplify complex data through abstraction
- Group specific types of data

Objects
- Events: most commonly used 
- Searches: splunk searches that include transforming commands, etc.
- Transactions: combine multiple events from one or many sources into a single event.
