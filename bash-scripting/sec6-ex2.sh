# Write a script that renames files based on the file extension. The script should prompt the user for a file extension. Next, it should ask the user what prefix to prepend to the file name(s). By default the prefix should be the current date in YYYY足MM足DD format. So, if the user simply presses enter the date will be used. Otherwise, whatever the user entered will be used as the prefix. Next, it should display the original file name and the new name of the file. Finally, it should rename the file.
CURRDATE=`date +%F`

      echo "Renaming $i to $1-$i"
      mv $i $1.$i
   done
